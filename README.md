# Newegg Project

The purpose of this project is to develop business insights from scraping Newegg's website for computer monitors for increasing sales.

The data analysis code is in Web_Scraping_Script.ipynb. The presentation  is in Newegg Computer Monitors.pptx. The data I scraped is in Newegg.csv.

Here is a link to the blog post where I explain the project: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/web-scraping/data-analysis-of-newegg-computer-monitors/
